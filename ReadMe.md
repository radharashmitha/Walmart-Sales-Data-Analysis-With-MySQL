# **Walmart Sales Data Analysis with SQL**
## **About**

The Walmart Sales Data Analysis project is designed to delve into Walmartâ€™s sales data to identify high-performing branches and products, analyze sales trends, and understand customer behavior. The goal is to enhance and refine sales strategies. Data for this study comes from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition, which includes historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores across various regions. Participants are tasked with forecasting sales for each department within these stores, taking into account the impact of holiday markdown events on sales.

## **Project Objectives**

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1.	Understand the factors influencing sales across different Walmart branches.
2.	Analyze product performance and identify areas for improvement.
3.	Explore sales trends to evaluate the effectiveness of sales strategies.
4.	Segment customers based on purchasing behavior and profitability.

## **Approach Used**
### **1.	Data Wrangling:** 
- Inspect data for NULL values and replace missing data.
### **2. Database Construction:**
-	Create tables and insert data.
- Set NOT NULL constraints to filter out null values.
### **3.	Feature Engineering:**
   - **Add new columns:**
   - **time_of_day:** Insight into sales during morning, afternoon, and evening
   - **day_name:** Extracted days of the week (Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur, Fri) to analyze weekly patterns.
   - **month_name:** Extracted months (Jan, Feb, Mar) to determine peak sales months.
### **4.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
-	Answer project-specific questions using data insights.
  
## **Usage**
1.	Install any necessary dependencies.
2.	Set up the database and create tables.
3.	Execute queries for analysis (e.g., product analysis, sales trends, customer segmentation).
